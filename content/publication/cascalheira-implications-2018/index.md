abstract: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is reported to affect 6.8% of the population of the United States, but often goes undiagnosed due to perceived stigma. Left untreated, PTSD has deleterious effects on quality of life, harming families, employers, and taxpayers with loss of life, loss of productivity, and elevated risk for criminality and addiction. Health care providers and employers play a vital role in reducing stigma, which derives, in part, from the nature of the trauma. Expanded routine screening, psychoeducation of stakeholders, and computer-mediated therapy may diminish stigma-related costs and improve access to care. The implications of stigma as a barrier to treatment should be considered in further research on the public health outcomes of PTSD.
