abstract: 'Because of their stigmatized social status, sexual and gen-der minority (SGM; e.g., gay, transgender) people experi-ence minority stress (i.e., identity-based stress arising from adverse social conditions). Given that minority stress is the leading framework for understanding health inequity among SGM people, researchers and clinicians need accu-rate methods to detect minority stress. Since social media fulfills important developmental, affiliative, and coping functions for SGM people, social media may be an ecolog-ically valid channel for detecting minority stress. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory (BI-LSTM) network for classifying minority stress dis-closed on Reddit. Our experiments on a dataset of 12,645 Reddit posts resulted in an average accuracy of 65%.'
