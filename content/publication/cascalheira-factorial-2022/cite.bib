	abstract = {The dimensionality and factorial invariance of scores on the Self-Objectification Beliefs and Behaviors Scale (SOBBS) were examined with a sample of 590 transgender and nonbinary participants. Results failed to disconfirm the two-factor model and provided adequate estimates of internal consistency reliability. Strong, strict, and structural invariance of scores were observed.},
