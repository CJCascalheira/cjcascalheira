**Computational Methods Investigating Psychosocial Stressors (CMIPS)**

This project has received [IRB approval](https://www.cjcascalheira.com/uploads/CMIPS_IRB-approval.pdf).

The overarching goal of CMIPS is to apply artificial intelligence to understand how LGBTQ+ people talk about stressful experiences on Facebook and/or Twitter. There are three specific aims to this project.

**Aim 1**. Use machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to model psychosocial stressors *as a dichotomous outcome* (e.g., high vs. low stress) among LGBTQ+ people using their Facebook and/or Twitter data. 

**Aim 2**. Use machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to model psychosocial stressors *as a continuous outcome* among LGBTQ+ people using their Facebook and/or Twitter data. 

**Aim 3**. Understand the acceptability of passive sensing, artificial intelligence, and computationally enhanced digital health among LGBTQ+ people. 

Results will help support the development of technology-delivered mental health tools (e.g., digital mental health apps) specifically designed for LGBTQ+ people.
