**Computational Methods Investigating Psychosocial Stressors (CMIPS)**

The aim of this project is to use machine learning and natural language processing to model psychosocial stressors among LGBTQ+ people using their Facebook and/or Twitter data. In other words, to apply artificial intelligence to understand how LGBTQ+ people talk about stressful experiences on Facebook and/or Twitter. 

Results will help support the development of technology-delivered mental health tools (e.g., digital mental health apps) specifically designed for LGBTQ+ people.

Check out the visual consent form to learn more.
