**Computational Methods Investigating Psychosocial Stressors (CMIPS)**

The aim of this project is to use machine learning and natural language processing to model psychosocial stressors among LGBTQ+ people using their Facebook and/or Twitter data. In other words, to apply artificial intelligence to understand how LGBTQ+ people talk about stressful experiences on Facebook and/or Twitter. 

Results will help support the development of technology-delivered mental health tools (e.g., digital mental health apps) specifically designed for LGBTQ+ people.

**Project Funding**

* NIH Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (RISE) Fellowship (R25GM061222, PI Houston, Trainee Cascalheira)
