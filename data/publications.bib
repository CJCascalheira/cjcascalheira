	abstract = {Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is reported to affect 6.8\% of the population of the United States, but often goes undiagnosed due to perceived stigma. Left untreated, PTSD has deleterious effects on quality of life, harming families, employers, and taxpayers with loss of life, loss of productivity, and elevated risk for criminality and addiction. Health care providers and employers play a vital role in reducing stigma, which derives, in part, from the nature of the trauma. Expanded routine screening, psychoeducation of stakeholders, and computer-mediated therapy may diminish stigma-related costs and improve access to care. The implications of stigma as a barrier to treatment should be considered in further research on the public health outcomes of PTSD.},

	abstract = {Men who have sex with men (MSM) increasingly rely on geosocial networking (GSN) smartphone applications (“apps”), such as Grindr and Scruff, to form sexual networks. Using social identity theory as a framework, the present study employed images to offer a quantitative assessment of bias in favor of masculinity (heteronormative, effeminate) and ethnicity (Asian, Black, Latino, White). Participants (N = 395) completed a survey that simulated the use of GSN apps and measured social identity salience. A mixed-subjects ANOVA revealed main effects for masculinity and ethnicity. The interaction was significant, but a small effect size suggests MSM appraise each construct separately during partner selection. Pairwise comparisons demonstrated that White and Latino heteronormative photos were the most preferred prototypes among all participants, regardless of their self-reported ethnicity. Thus, in-demand identities are more masculine and lighter-appearing, with European features, even among Black and Asian MSM. Asian participants scored highest on social identity salience, which was statistically equivalent among other ethnicities. Additionally, race-based stereotypes about sexual position were not associated with social identity salience. That is, Asian MSM were as likely as Black MSM to identify as tops, bottoms, or versatile. Although ethnic minority MSM do not define their sexual positions in terms of stereotypes, their ability to be desirable objects may hinge on the stereotypical expectations of potential partners.},

Drawing on a survey of 565 British adults aged 18?32 collected at the peak of social lockdown restrictions, we document an overall decrease in sexual behaviors consistent with abiding by social restrictions. We found that the levels of sexual desire reported by women (but not men) decreased compared with reports of pre-lockdown levels. Participants in serious relationships reported more increases in sexual activity than people who were single or dating casually, and there were significant differences according to gender and sexual orientation. The perceived impact of subjective wellbeing of people with high sociosexuality scores was disproportionately associated with social lockdown but there was no effect for general health. Thus, the impact on sexuality and general wellbeing should be considered by policymakers when considering future social restrictions related to COVID-19 or other public health emergencies.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.esxm.2021.100342},
	abstract = {Introduction: Pandemic-related social lockdown limited many sexual behaviors, but to date, no study has examined the perceived impact of social lockdown due to COVID-19 on sexual fantasy and solitary sexual behavior.

Aims: The present study sought to examine the perceived impact of social lockdown on sexual fantasy and solitary sexual behavior among UK young adults in various living situations.

Methods: A convenience sample of 565 adults aged 18-32 and living in the UK completed anonymous, web-based, study-specific questionnaires between May 14 and 18, 2020, 7 weeks after social lockdown was initiated. Mixed-method analyses were conducted.

Main outcome measures: The study presents qualitative and quantitative data. Criterion variables were measured dichotomously as increases (vs no change) in sexual fantasy and increases (vs no change) in pornography consumption. Predictor variables were living arrangement, relationship status, and postlockdown changes in masturbation and pornography consumption.

Results: Of all, 34.3\% engaged in more sexual fantasizing during lockdown; women were more likely than men to report this increase. Living context and relationship status were predictors of increased fantasizing. Of all, 30.44\% reported an increase in at least one solitary sexual practice. This increase was associated with an increase in sexual fantasizing and also with increased pornography consumption. Nineteen percent of participants reported an increase in pornography use, with men being more likely than women to report this increase. Participants mostly attributed their increases to boredom, increased free time, and replacing partnered sex.

Conclusion: Shifts in sexual fantasizing and solitary sexual practices were predicted by living arrangements, relationship status, and gender. The present findings suggest that the assessment of sexual fantasy and solitary sexual activities may benefit patients presenting with pandemic-related stress. Although mostly exploratory, significant changes in sexual fantasy and solitary sexual practices were observed. A cross-sectional design, convenience sampling, and study-specific measures are limitations. Cascalheira CJ, McCormack M, Portch E, et al.

	abstract = {Bondage/discipline, dominance/submission, and sadism/masochism (BDSM; “kink”) are frequently pathologized as derivatives of abuse. Although the link is unsubstantiated, some kink-identified people who happen to be survivors of trauma may engage in kink, or trauma play, to heal from, cope with, and transform childhood abuse or adolescent maltreatment. The present study sought a thematic model (Braun \& Clarke, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3(2), 77–101, 2006) of trauma recovery through kink using a critical realist, inductive approach to inquiry. Participants were eligible if they had experienced early abuse, were adults, and practiced kink. Six superordinate themes were generated from semi-structured interviews with 20 participants from five countries: cultural context of healing (e.g. using BDSM norms and previous therapy to reframe kink and trauma), restructuring the self-concept (e.g. strengthening internal characteristics which had been harmed or distorted), liberation through relationship (e.g. learning to be valued by intimate others), reclaiming power (e.g. setting and maintaining personal boundaries), repurposing behaviors (e.g. engaging in aspects of prolonged exposure), and redefining pain (e.g. transcending painful memories through masochism). Notably, participants only reported retraumatizing experiences prior to learning about the structural safeguards of BDSM. Research and clinical implications are discussed by drawing on general models of trauma recovery.},

Hence, this phenomenological study focuses on the PK-12 school-related experiences of bi and trans parents. Using queer theory as a theoretical framework, we review relevant literature on family hegemony, gender biases, and heteronormativity within school settings and its impact on children with queer families. Then, we discuss the methods and analysis used to understand the experiences of bi and trans parent participants. Analysis revealed four themes: (a) concern for the child; (b) value for diversity; (c) heteronormative nature of schools; and (d) importance of inclusivity.

	abstract = {Trauma-exposed sexual minority women (SMW) are at elevated risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and hazardous drinking compared to trauma-exposed heterosexual women. To understand whether these problems might be exacerbated during times of elevated societal stress, we collected data from a New York-based sample of trauma-exposed SMW between April 2020 and August 2020, a period of notable, compounding societal stressors, including: (a) living in or near one of the first epicenters of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in the United States and (b) living through multiple high-profile occurrences of racism-related police violence and subsequent racial unrest. SMW (n?=?68) completed online self-report questionnaires related to trauma, PTSD symptoms, and alcohol use, and a subset (n?=?29) completed semi-structured qualitative interviews. PsycINFO was searched with terms related to SMW, PTSD, and alcohol use to identify studies with samples of SMW from articles published within the last 10?years to which we could compare our sample; this produced nine studies. Welch?s t-tests and Chi-square analyses revealed that SMW within our sample reported significantly higher PTSD symptom severity, probable PTSD, and hazardous drinking indicators (i.e., alcohol use disorder and heavy episodic drinking) between April 2020 and August 2020 compared to similar samples (i.e., trauma-exposed SMW and general samples of SMW) assessed previously. Qualitative reports also indicated that the societal stressors of 2020 contributed to mental and behavioral health concerns. These results underscore the need for integrated PTSD and alcohol use prevention and intervention efforts for trauma-exposed SMW during times of heightened societal stress.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2021.2006132 .},

After the intervention, the participants completed measures of sexual prejudice, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), gender role beliefs (GRB), and a demographic questionnaire. Results from the first step of hierarchical regression models showed that RWA and GRB were significantly predictive of all dimensions of heterosexism except for positive stereotypic, accounting for 13.8\% to 56.7\% of the variance. This suggests that interventions targeting sexual prejudice should examine both variables. When between-group comparisons were added during the second step, the didactic intervention in comparison with the control group was significantly predictive of lower paternalistic heterosexism; the perspective-taking intervention in comparison with the control group was significantly predictive of lower positive stereotypic heterosexism.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected HIV-positive cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM). Between May and June in 2020, we conducted one-on-one semi-structured qualitative interviews with 20 HIV-positive MSM aiming to describe their (dis)connection to social, sexual, and health networks during the COVID-19 pandemic. All participants relied on social support networks to manage pandemic-based distress, using computer-mediated communication as well as physical proximity. To connect to sexual networks, this sample described adaptations to their partner selection strategies, such as enumerating harm reduction approaches. To connect to health networks, participants depended on reassuring providers, resourceful case managers, telehealth, and streamlined access to their antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications. Nonetheless, stay-at-home recommendations reduced community connection, sexual activity, and healthcare access for many participants, and perceptions of these losses were shaped by psychosocial burdens (e.g. loneliness), structural burdens (e.g. environmental barriers, financial difficulties), and health-protective factors (e.g. hopeful outlook, adherence to a regular routine). The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have exacerbated health-related issues for HIV-positive MSM. Given the ongoing COVID-19 mutations, community-based organisations, clinicians, and researchers might use these findings to modify HIV prevention and intervention efforts.},

	volume = {238},
	doi = {10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109550},
	abstract = {Background
Syndemics (i.e., multiple, co-occurring, and synergistic conditions) contribute to elevated substance use among sexual and gender minority (SGM) people relative to heterosexual, cisgender people. Research suggests that syndemic-informed and SGM-tailored treatments are effective in substance use treatment among SGM people. However, few studies have examined 1) the proportion of substance use treatment facilities offering syndemic-informed, SGM-tailored treatment programming; and 2) the availability and accessibility of syndemic-informed, SGM-tailored treatment programs across the U.S.
Methods
We used the 2020 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) dataset to perform a latent class analysis examining whether substance use treatment facilities’ tailored treatment programs cluster together to form distinct classes indicating whether facilities offer syndemic-informed and SGM-tailored programming. We then used multinomial logistic regression to examine associations between class membership and facility availability and accessibility.
Results
Analyses revealed four classes of substance use treatment facilities’ tailored programs. Facilities with syndemic-informed and SGM-tailored treatment programs compared to facilities with no tailored programs were more likely to be in the Northeast compared to the Midwest and South; to offer payment assistance versus not offer payment assistance; and to be private, for-profit facilities versus public or non-profit facilities.
Conclusions
This study’s findings identify the need for more facilities with syndemic-informed and SGM-tailored treatment, particularly in the Midwestern and Southern U.S. regions. Facilities offering syndemic-informed and SGM-tailored treatment might present accessibility barriers for low-income SGM people, as they were more likely to be private, for-profit facilities; however, they were more likely to offer payment assistance.},

(RQ2) What are preservice teachers? perceptions of designing socially just math lessons using fieldtrips? We provide an overview of previous literature, describe the project we designed, and provide an analysis of preservice teachers? experiences and perceptions of this project. Thematic analysis of student journals and final assignments generated eight overarching themes and three subordinate themes organized by three phases. Organization by phases indicates a structural approach that teacher educators may use when introducing a similar activity. Further analysis revealed elementary preservice teachers emphasized the beneficial challenge of this assignment, suggesting that math-based social justice field trips are important additions to teacher education programs.
